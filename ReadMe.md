# App Academy Mock Takehome Challenges

## Steps to start up the project
* First clone the project to a new directory you created
* Change directory to the main project directory
  * After that type `npm install` to install all required dependencies
* When that's complete you should open two terminals up
  * One for the backend folder and the other for the frontend

* Have fun!
